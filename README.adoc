= Resource Analysis and Grouping for Eclipse

A simple eclipse plugin that allows creating bookmarks and notes, based on the
topic you want fixed. Simply add the plugin into your `eclipse/plugins` folder,
then open the view using the Eclipse menu: `Window > Show View > Other`, and
pick `RAGE` from the list.

You can create _groups_, that are just logical structures for you, such as bug
ids, functionality, etc. In these groups you can drag and drop file resources
from the project explorer, so you will create _file references_ inside the
_group_ where the file is dropped.

In the _file references_ you can create bookmarks in the actual file using the
toolbar icons (the plus minus things).

The _file location_ is either the line number, or some text that the line is
containing. Of course you can have multiple _file locations_ in a _file
reference_.

The same resource since it's just a bookmark can be present multiple times in
RAGE, in different groups.
